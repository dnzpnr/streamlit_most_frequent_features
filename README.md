# streamlit_most_frequent_features

In this repo I tried to show you the most used streamlit commands with examples. But you need first install streamlit. 

And then open the py file on Atom, Pycharm or another python IDE. 

Then open the console and write <streamlit run streamlit_most_frequent_features>
  
After then you will see the web app on your browser. 
  
Best of luck to you...
